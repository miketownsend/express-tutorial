1. Add a button (and serverside functionality) which removes an instrument
	- add a new DELETE api/instruments endpoint.
	- make sure you refresh the instruments on the page.
1. Add a new html page with a form for adding an instrument
	- you will need to add a POST api/instruments endpoint.
	- read up on HTML Form elements how they work and how to override their submit functionality so you can use AJAX.
